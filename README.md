notebook to process an NMR strayfield image from a CPMG sequence

The ipyhon notebooks in this directory are just short scripts to process NMR data acquired in the stray magnetic field of a supeconducting magnet.

The first example, shows the processing of data collected using a CPMG pulse sequence of a phantom containing three thin circular disks of a polymer seperated by two disks of cardboard. The diameter of the disks are 3mm. The sample was spun at 8 kHz at the magic angle.
